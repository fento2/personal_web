                <p>Hello, I'm Fendry Tonrate â€” a passionate Software Developer with a love for clean code, beautiful UI, and solving real-world problems with technology.
                    I specialize in building responsive and scalable web applications using modern frameworks like React and Next.js. I enjoy turning complex challenges into simple, intuitive solutions.
                    Outside of coding, I'm often exploring new tech tools, improving my design skills, or just chilling while planning my next project.
                    Let's create something impactful together.
